I have contributed to many open source projects be it code or documentation. By maintaining and contributing to these projects, I've learned about a
lot of effective community building, communication, and documentation.

I've also learned a lot about programming, and I've been able to apply that knowledge to my own projects.

Major contributions:
- [drf-user](https://github.com/101loop/drf-user)
- Several Projects at [101 Loop](https://github.com/101loop)
