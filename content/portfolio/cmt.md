Day-to-day responsibilities include but not limited to the following:

- Optimised APIs on already built products. Reduced API response time for 2.5
  seconds to 250 ms.
- Reduced computational complexities to linear complexity in different portion of
  codebase.
- Optimised Django’s ORM queries to reduce computational time by reducing
  query complexity from 2n+1 to linear using Django ORM features. For
  instance, in an API reduced 1000+ queries to 10 queries.
- Automated deployments of the products using Github Actions.
- Established test case structure and increased coverage from 0% to 93%, mostly
  using e2e test cases. Avoided unit test because of time constraint.
