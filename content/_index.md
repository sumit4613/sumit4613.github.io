I'm a software engineer from India.
Exploring the world of software development, and trying to figure out life.

Things which tells that I'm a software engineer:

- Mentor beginner developers on how to contribute to open source projects in PyCon India. Participated in 2020 and 2021.
- Refactored and Increased code coverage of [drf-user](https://github.com/101loop/drf-user) from 0% to
  96%. ([Total downloads](https://pepy.tech/project/drf-user) till now ~45k)
- Need to add more things here. (I'm lazy)
